âœ¨ I'm a Frontend Developer always looking to improve the UI/UX and accessibility of products. I've architected the [open-source Graphite Design System](https://github.com/paqtcom/graphite-design-system) using Web Components & Eleventy. Skilled in creating native mobile apps with Ionic & Capacitor, web applications with Vue & Nuxt (using TypeScript), and REST APIâ€™s with Laravel. Using tools like Cypress, Auth0, Contentful, and GitHub Actions. My contributions also involved designing wireframes.

I live in Utrecht, the Netherlands and currently work at Nordhealth.
